      <h2 style="font-variant:small-caps">About</h2>

      <p> I am a Microeconomist and applied econometrician with research interests in Taxation, Public Economics,
and Decision Theory. 
      </p>

      <p>My current research agenda focuses on the effects of corporate and dividend taxation
on firms, the effect of corporate tax avoidance behaviour on the measurement of economic inequality, public
economics, and the effects of uncertainty on entrepreneurship, pollution, and taxes. I am currently working
on multiple projects investigating these issues in Canada, and Chile. These projects use a combination of
applied economic theory, development of new empirical methods and the use of administrative datasets to
provide rigorous answers to the questions that I aim to tackle. For all of them, I bring together my thorough
knowledge of public finance, applied theory, applied econometrics, and vast experience working with large-
scale administrative datasets, and statistical tools.</p>

We estimate spatially disaggregated measures of intergenerational mobility in Chile through
        an administrative dataset linking child’s and their parent’s earnings from the formal private
        labour sector. We report remarkable heterogeneity as we find higher and lower upward mobility 
        in mining and agricultural regions, respectively, corroborating Connolly et al. (2019) with 
        the distinction that Chile is a unitary form of government, implying that factors other than 
        institutional differences shape mobility. We also find statistically significant gender gaps 
        in persistence in poverty, persistence in privilege, and upward mobility.

        We explore the effect of raising economic uncertainty on local and global carbon
emissions. Most economic models under uncertainty focus on the effect of risk on
the supply of a control variable (e.g., emissions). Here we explore the effect of risk
on both the supply and demand of local and global carbon emissions and, therefore,
on their equilibrium shadow prices. We show that in addition to the consumers ́ level
of risk aversion and prudence coefficient, an additional parameter not included in
standard models, the elasticity of substitution between pollution and conventional
inputs, plays a key role as a determinant of local and global emissions. An important
implication of the analysis is that, under various specifications widely used for
preferences and production technologies, a damning vicious cycle between
increasing economic uncertainty and global pollution emissions is likely to occur.

      <p>&#8226 "Gini and Undercoverage at the Upper tail: a simple approximation"
        <strong><em>International Tax and Public Finance</em></strong> 29, 443–471. 2022.
        <br>

      <div id="abstractgini" class="hidden">
This paper investigates the impact of top-distribution undercoverage on the Gini coefficient. First, we show that failing to correct for underreporting and nonresponse at the top does not necessarily result in an underestimated Gini coefficient. Then, we establish analytical conditions under which the Gini coefficient of the uncorrected distribution is higher than the Gini coefficient of the true distribution, i.e. the distribution that incorporates underreporting and/or nonresponse. In addition, we propose a Gini approximation based on the Atkinson approximation G=G1−p⋅(1−Sp)+Sp to correct for underreporting at the top. Under plausible assumptions, the approximation proposed is very close to the real Gini coefficient. We also show that before correcting for underreporting we need to first address the issue of nonresponse as otherwise the approximation may be strongly upper biased. Finally, this work proposes a procedure to estimate the fraction of nonrespondents at the very top under the assumption that underreported incomes belong to individuals with incomes higher than those reported in a household survey. To evaluate the proposed methodologies, this paper uses Chile and Canada as examples, where we include undistributed business profits—an underreported source of income—to measure income inequality.

      <p>&#8226 "The Distribution of COVID-19 Related Risks"
        <strong><em>Canadian Journal of Economics</em></strong> 29, 443–471. 2022.
        <br>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <a class="abstractcovid" href="javascript:unhide(&#39;abstractcovid&#39;);">Abstract</a>
      </p>
      <div id="abstractcovid" class="hidden">
We document two COVID-19–related risks, viral risk and employment risk, and their distributions across the Canadian population. The measurement of viral risk is based on the VSE COVID-19 Risk/Reward Assessment Tool, created to assist policy-makers in determining the impacts of pandemic-related economic shutdowns and re-openings. Women are more concentrated in high-viral-transmission-risk occupations, which is the source of their greater employment loss over the first part of the pandemic. They were also less likely to maintain contact with their former employers, reducing employment recovery rates. Low-educated workers face the same viral risk rates as high-educated workers but much higher employment losses. This is largely due to their lower likelihood of switching to working from home. For both women and the low-educated, existing inequities in their occupational distributions and living situations have resulted in them bearing a disproportionate amount of the risk emerging from the pandemic. Assortative matching in couples has tended to exacerbate risk inequities.
