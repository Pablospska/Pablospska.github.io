      <p> I am a Microeconomist and applied econometrician with research interests in Taxation, Public Economics,
and Decision Theory. 
      </p>

      <p>My current research agenda focuses on the effects of corporate and dividend taxation
on firms, the effect of corporate tax avoidance behaviour on the measurement of economic inequality, public
economics, and the effects of uncertainty on entrepreneurship, pollution, and taxes. I am currently working
on multiple projects investigating these issues in Canada, and Chile. These projects use a combination of
applied economic theory, development of new empirical methods and the use of administrative datasets to
provide rigorous answers to the questions that I aim to tackle. For all of them, I bring together my
 knowledge of public finance, applied theory, applied econometrics, and vast experience working with large-scale
 administrative datasets, and statistical tools.</p>

We assess firms' taxable income response to a dividend tax credit increase when corporate and personal taxes are integrated. To do so, we use the presence of a kink in the Canadian tax system. First, we theoretically show that, in an integrated tax system, welfare changes stemming from a rise in corporate taxes depend on two parameters: the elasticity of taxable income with respect to the corporate tax rate and with respect to the dividend tax credit. Second, to estimate both parameters, we propose an identification strategy that relies on the bunching methodology and the excess bunching difference before and after a tax reform that increased the dividend tax credit. Using Canadian administrative tax data, we estimate these elasticities and empirically show that the increase in the dividend tax credit reduced the deadweight loss associated with an increase in the corporate tax by more than 50%. Our results are robust to a battery of robustness checks, including nonparametric estimates of the counterfactual density in the bunching procedure.

This paper revisits the Two-Sample Two-Stage Least Squares (TSTSLS) method,
which is commonly used to estimate intergenerational mobility in the absence of
parental earnings data. First, we decompose the TSTSLS intergenerational earnings
elasticity (IGE) into the linked administrative data estimate, a projection bias, and a
variance bias. We propose a parsimonious imputation procedure to eliminate the vari-
ance bias in the IGE and show that, under plausible conditions, the corrected TSTSLS
IGE estimate provides a lower bound for the linked administrative IGE. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the uncorrected rank-rank correlation estimated through TSTSLS
only exhibits projection bias, thus providing a lower bound to the linked administrative
rank-rank correlation. Second, we use administrative data from a developing country
to test our lower bound methodology through an Empirical Monte Carlo approach,
confirming its validity. These estimates suggest that the following practices should be
implemented when the TSTSLS method is used to estimate intergenerational mobility:
i) report the variance bias corrected-IGE; and ii) report the results of the rank-rank cor-
relation estimated through TSTSLS. Our empirical results shows that both estimates
provide a lower bound for the linked administrative IGE and rank-rank correlation,
respectively.      </div>

This paper provides the first robust estimates of intergenerational mobility using administrative data for parents and children in Chile. Using a unique dataset that links a child's and their parent's earnings from the formal private labour sector, we estimate that the intergenerational earnings elasticity is between 0.275 and 0.312, whereas the rank-rank slope is between 0.249 and 0.268. In addition, we find significant nonlinearities in these measures, as intergenerational mobility is very high in the bottom 80% of the parents' distribution and bottom 65% of the children's distribution, but with remarkably high persistence in the upper part of the earnings distribution. We also document statistically significant heterogeneity by gender. Specifically, we find that the association between mothers' and female children's earnings is higher than for male children. In addition, persistence in poverty is higher for female children than for male children, upward mobility is higher for male children, persistence in privilege is higher for male children, and children's intergenerational gender gap decreases as parental earnings increase. In particular, we find significant nonlinearities in the gender gap at the upper tail of fathers' earnings distribution, suggesting that the gender dynamics of intergenerational mobility at the upper tail are different from the rest of the population.

This paper proposes a new methodology to value retained earnings as income by transforming
them into accrued capital gains and develops a parametric procedure to impute corporate retained
earnings to households. We use this approach to estimate income inequality for Canada using
household survey data, and aggregate retained earnings information from national accounts. We
show that including retained earnings by transforming it into accrued capital gains increases income
inequality in Canada and changes the trend in income inequality, exhibiting more consistency
with the decline in capital income after the Great Recession. This result is robust after using a
capitalization approach to impute retained earnings.

We estimate spatially disaggregated measures of intergenerational mobility in Chile through
        an administrative dataset linking child’s and their parent’s earnings from the formal private
        labour sector. We report remarkable heterogeneity as we find higher and lower upward mobility 
        in mining and agricultural regions, respectively, corroborating Connolly et al. (2019) with 
        the distinction that Chile is a unitary form of government, implying that factors other than 
        institutional differences shape mobility. We also find statistically significant gender gaps 
        in persistence in poverty, persistence in privilege, and upward mobility.

      <div id="abstractreferendum" class="hidden">
The intergenerational earnings elasticity (IGE) is widely recognized as a measure of the degree of transmission of privileges or disadvantages from a parent to his child in society.  This paper develops a simple theoretical model that predicts a lower provision of public goods given an increase in the IGE. We test this model empirically using the results of the 2020 Chilean national plebiscite, which asked for the replacement of the standing constitution imposed in 1980 by Pinochet’s military dictatorship and that enshrined the subsidiary, market-oriented role of the Chilean state. Our estimates suggest the existence of a positive association between the IGE and the share of the vote against a new constitution that would potentially allow deep reforms in the healthcare, education, and pension systems. Additionally, we find a positive relationship between the share of the vote for a partially democratically elected writing body --- rather than a fully elected one --- and the IGE. These results are robust to the inclusion of additional socioeconomic variables and to the use of alternative measures of intergenerational persistence, such as the rank-rank correlation and top-quintile transition probabilities. These findings are consistent with our model and suggest that sectors of society exhibiting higher degrees of economic persistence also show greater reluctance towards egalitarian reforms of redistributive institutions.

We study the conditions under which increasing risk raises the optimal control variable when the budget constraint is nonlinear. In contrast to the case when the budget constraint is linear, nonlinearities alter the risk attitudes of the economic agent; that is, the agent’s risk behavior is driven by the interaction between the shape of the utility function and the shape of the budget constraint. This paper complements the classical literature with linear payoff functions in two important ways. First, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for unambiguous comparative statics of changes in risk when the budget constraint is nonlinear. Second, we highlight the critical role of the coefficients of technological improvement and cross-prudence in technology derived from the nonlinear budget constraint in a similar form to that in which the coefficient of relative risk aversion and the coefficient of relative prudence are derived from the utility function. We show several applications of this theory, including the worker’s decision to work in-person during a pandemic.

        We explore the effect of raising economic uncertainty on local and global carbon
emissions. Most economic models under uncertainty focus on the effect of risk on
the supply of a control variable (e.g., emissions). Here we explore the effect of risk
on both the supply and demand of local and global carbon emissions and, therefore,
on their equilibrium shadow prices. We show that in addition to the consumers ́ level
of risk aversion and prudence coefficient, an additional parameter not included in
standard models, the elasticity of substitution between pollution and conventional
inputs, plays a key role as a determinant of local and global emissions. An important
implication of the analysis is that, under various specifications widely used for
preferences and production technologies, a damning vicious cycle between
increasing economic uncertainty and global pollution emissions is likely to occur.

      <div id="abstractgini" class="hidden">
This paper investigates the impact of top-distribution undercoverage on the Gini coefficient. First, we show that failing to correct for underreporting and nonresponse at the top does not necessarily result in an underestimated Gini coefficient. Then, we establish analytical conditions under which the Gini coefficient of the uncorrected distribution is higher than the Gini coefficient of the true distribution, i.e. the distribution that incorporates underreporting and/or nonresponse. In addition, we propose a Gini approximation based on the Atkinson approximation G=G*⋅(1−Sp)+Sp to correct for underreporting at the top. Under plausible assumptions, the approximation proposed is very close to the real Gini coefficient. We also show that before correcting for underreporting we need to first address the issue of nonresponse as otherwise the approximation may be strongly upper biased. Finally, this work proposes a procedure to estimate the fraction of nonrespondents at the very top under the assumption that underreported incomes belong to individuals with incomes higher than those reported in a household survey. To evaluate the proposed methodologies, this paper uses Chile and Canada as examples, where we include undistributed business profits—an underreported source of income—to measure income inequality.

      <div id="abstractcovid" class="hidden">
We document two COVID-19–related risks, viral risk and employment risk, and their distributions across the Canadian population. The measurement of viral risk is based on the VSE COVID-19 Risk/Reward Assessment Tool, created to assist policy-makers in determining the impacts of pandemic-related economic shutdowns and re-openings. Women are more concentrated in high-viral-transmission-risk occupations, which is the source of their greater employment loss over the first part of the pandemic. They were also less likely to maintain contact with their former employers, reducing employment recovery rates. Low-educated workers face the same viral risk rates as high-educated workers but much higher employment losses. This is largely due to their lower likelihood of switching to working from home. For both women and the low-educated, existing inequities in their occupational distributions and living situations have resulted in them bearing a disproportionate amount of the risk emerging from the pandemic. Assortative matching in couples has tended to exacerbate risk inequities.

We incorporate ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) into a classic model of entrepreneurship to analyze, among other things, its effects on the optimal level of business startups, the relation between total assets and the size of the entrepreneurial investment, the effects of increasing ambiguity on developing new ventures, and the decision to self-select into entrepreneurship for an indifferent decision maker. We first show that, under the monotone-likelihood ratio property, the introduction of ambiguity negatively affects the optimal entrepreneurial investment, something that is consistent with most experimental evidence about entrepreneurial choice under ambiguity. Then, we show that the classical explanations for the positive correlation between total assets and business startups based on decreasing absolute risk aversion preferences and prudent behavior can be challenged when ambiguity is incorporated into the analysis, and we provide the conditions that guarantee that the traditional comparative static result under risk is replicated under ambiguity. We also show that increases in ambiguity aversion reduce entrepreneurial activities. Finally, we discuss our results under alternative ways of modeling ambiguity.

We introduce the concept of weak tax neutrality that establishes that the relationship between the tax rate and the user cost of capital may be non-monotonic. We show that most existing corporate tax systems allow for weak neutrality. That is, given the tax allowances permitted by these systems, it is possible that neutrality may arise for at least one positive corporate tax rate. Moreover, we show the practical relevance of weak neutrality in realistic situations where there are several asset types and heterogeneous levels of firms' debt ratios.

This paper aims to study the effect of family socioeconomic status (SES) on academic and labor market outcomes. The authors used a rich data set of administrative records for test scores, individual background and adult earnings of a cohort of agents, covering a period spanning the agents' upper-secondary education and their early years in the labor market. The authors find that students with the highest SES obtained a 1.5 standard deviations higher score in the college admission test than students who had the same academic outcomes in the eighth grade test but belong to the lowest SES. Similarly, among students that obtained the same scores in the college admission test, those with the highest SES earned monthly wages 0.7 standard deviations higher than those with the lowest SES. The findings highlight that family socioeconomic background continues to influence outcomes during individuals’ upper secondary education and early years in the labor market.

Most previous studies of income inequality have either ignored capital gains or have used taxable realized capital gains to estimate top incomes. Neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory. We apply for the first time a new methodology that allows us to account for fundamental accrued capital gains as part of the top incomes in a theoretically consistent manner. We estimate the shares of the super-rich in Chile showing that accrued capital gains have a large impact on these estimates. Also, the top income shares estimated using fundamental capital gains appear to exhibit a more stable and presumably more plausible time profile than estimates based on capital gains derived from asset market variations.

We use a new narrative measure of fiscal shocks to study how private consumption reacts to government spending increases. Our fiscal shocks arise from three announcements of expansionary fiscal rule deviations in a small and open economy where fiscal policy follows a structural-balance fiscal rule. All those deviations were announced to be mainly on the spending side. We find a negative response of private consumption in the face of those announcements. Our findings are consistent with the existence of consumers expecting some irreversibility in government spending increases and, as a consequence, a rise in future taxes to make the newly announced fiscal spending path consistent with the intertemporal government budget constraint.
