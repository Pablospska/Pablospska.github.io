      <h2 style="font-variant:small-caps">About</h2>

      <p> I am a Microeconomist and applied econometrician with research interests in Taxation, Public Economics,
and Decision Theory. 
      </p>

      <p>My current research agenda focuses on the effects of corporate and dividend taxation
on firms, the effect of corporate tax avoidance behaviour on the measurement of economic inequality, public
economics, and the effects of uncertainty on entrepreneurship, pollution, and taxes. I am currently working
on multiple projects investigating these issues in Canada, and Chile. These projects use a combination of
applied economic theory, development of new empirical methods and the use of administrative datasets to
provide rigorous answers to the questions that I aim to tackle. For all of them, I bring together my thorough
knowledge of public finance, applied theory, applied econometrics, and vast experience working with large-scale
 administrative datasets, and statistical tools.</p>

We estimate spatially disaggregated measures of intergenerational mobility in Chile through
        an administrative dataset linking child’s and their parent’s earnings from the formal private
        labour sector. We report remarkable heterogeneity as we find higher and lower upward mobility 
        in mining and agricultural regions, respectively, corroborating Connolly et al. (2019) with 
        the distinction that Chile is a unitary form of government, implying that factors other than 
        institutional differences shape mobility. We also find statistically significant gender gaps 
        in persistence in poverty, persistence in privilege, and upward mobility.

        We explore the effect of raising economic uncertainty on local and global carbon
emissions. Most economic models under uncertainty focus on the effect of risk on
the supply of a control variable (e.g., emissions). Here we explore the effect of risk
on both the supply and demand of local and global carbon emissions and, therefore,
on their equilibrium shadow prices. We show that in addition to the consumers ́ level
of risk aversion and prudence coefficient, an additional parameter not included in
standard models, the elasticity of substitution between pollution and conventional
inputs, plays a key role as a determinant of local and global emissions. An important
implication of the analysis is that, under various specifications widely used for
preferences and production technologies, a damning vicious cycle between
increasing economic uncertainty and global pollution emissions is likely to occur.

This paper investigates the impact of top-distribution undercoverage on the Gini coefficient. First, we show that failing to correct for underreporting and nonresponse at the top does not necessarily result in an underestimated Gini coefficient. Then, we establish analytical conditions under which the Gini coefficient of the uncorrected distribution is higher than the Gini coefficient of the true distribution, i.e. the distribution that incorporates underreporting and/or nonresponse. In addition, we propose a Gini approximation based on the Atkinson approximation G=G1−p⋅(1−Sp)+Sp to correct for underreporting at the top. Under plausible assumptions, the approximation proposed is very close to the real Gini coefficient. We also show that before correcting for underreporting we need to first address the issue of nonresponse as otherwise the approximation may be strongly upper biased. Finally, this work proposes a procedure to estimate the fraction of nonrespondents at the very top under the assumption that underreported incomes belong to individuals with incomes higher than those reported in a household survey. To evaluate the proposed methodologies, this paper uses Chile and Canada as examples, where we include undistributed business profits—an underreported source of income—to measure income inequality.

      <div id="abstractcovid" class="hidden">
We document two COVID-19–related risks, viral risk and employment risk, and their distributions across the Canadian population. The measurement of viral risk is based on the VSE COVID-19 Risk/Reward Assessment Tool, created to assist policy-makers in determining the impacts of pandemic-related economic shutdowns and re-openings. Women are more concentrated in high-viral-transmission-risk occupations, which is the source of their greater employment loss over the first part of the pandemic. They were also less likely to maintain contact with their former employers, reducing employment recovery rates. Low-educated workers face the same viral risk rates as high-educated workers but much higher employment losses. This is largely due to their lower likelihood of switching to working from home. For both women and the low-educated, existing inequities in their occupational distributions and living situations have resulted in them bearing a disproportionate amount of the risk emerging from the pandemic. Assortative matching in couples has tended to exacerbate risk inequities.

We incorporate ambiguity (Knightian uncertainty) into a classic model of entrepreneurship to analyze, among other things, its effects on the optimal level of business startups, the relation between total assets and the size of the entrepreneurial investment, the effects of increasing ambiguity on developing new ventures, and the decision to self-select into entrepreneurship for an indifferent decision maker. We first show that, under the monotone-likelihood ratio property, the introduction of ambiguity negatively affects the optimal entrepreneurial investment, something that is consistent with most experimental evidence about entrepreneurial choice under ambiguity. Then, we show that the classical explanations for the positive correlation between total assets and business startups based on decreasing absolute risk aversion preferences and prudent behavior can be challenged when ambiguity is incorporated into the analysis, and we provide the conditions that guarantee that the traditional comparative static result under risk is replicated under ambiguity. We also show that increases in ambiguity aversion reduce entrepreneurial activities. Finally, we discuss our results under alternative ways of modeling ambiguity.

Building on the two-class income model (Banerjee and Yakovenko, 2010), this paper proposes a new methodology to estimate the income distribution that accounts for hidden sources of income, such as retained earnings. We promote and illustrate this methodology with a case study of the Chilean economy. Our results reveal that after including the hidden sources of income, economic inequality in Chile has remained relatively constant over the last 15 years.

We introduce the concept of weak tax neutrality that establishes that the relationship between the tax rate and the user cost of capital may be non-monotonic. We show that most existing corporate tax systems allow for weak neutrality. That is, given the tax allowances permitted by these systems, it is possible that neutrality may arise for at least one positive corporate tax rate. Moreover, we show the practical relevance of weak neutrality in realistic situations where there are several asset types and heterogeneous levels of firms' debt ratios.

This paper aims to study the effect of family socioeconomic status (SES) on academic and labor market outcomes. The authors used a rich data set of administrative records for test scores, individual background and adult earnings of a cohort of agents, covering a period spanning the agents' upper-secondary education and their early years in the labor market. The authors find that students with the highest SES obtained a 1.5 standard deviations higher score in the college admission test than students who had the same academic outcomes in the eighth grade test but belong to the lowest SES. Similarly, among students that obtained the same scores in the college admission test, those with the highest SES earned monthly wages 0.7 standard deviations higher than those with the lowest SES. The findings highlight that family socioeconomic background continues to influence outcomes during individuals’ upper secondary education and early years in the labor market.

Most previous studies of income inequality have either ignored capital gains or have used taxable realized capital gains to estimate top incomes. Neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory. We apply for the first time a new methodology that allows us to account for fundamental accrued capital gains as part of the top incomes in a theoretically consistent manner. We estimate the shares of the super-rich in Chile showing that accrued capital gains have a large impact on these estimates. Also, the top income shares estimated using fundamental capital gains appear to exhibit a more stable and presumably more plausible time profile than estimates based on capital gains derived from asset market variations.

We develop a method that allows transforming retained business profits in a particular year into business-accrued capital gains of the same year.

      </p>
      <div id="abstractbalance" class="hidden">
We use a new narrative measure of fiscal shocks to study how private consumption reacts to government spending increases. Our fiscal shocks arise from three announcements of expansionary fiscal rule deviations in a small and open economy where fiscal policy follows a structural-balance fiscal rule. All those deviations were announced to be mainly on the spending side. We find a negative response of private consumption in the face of those announcements. Our findings are consistent with the existence of consumers expecting some irreversibility in government spending increases and, as a consequence, a rise in future taxes to make the newly announced fiscal spending path consistent with the intertemporal government budget constraint.
